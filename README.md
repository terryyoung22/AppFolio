- [ ] Branch based deployments for Github Actions. Each branch represents a targeted project deployment. 
- [ ] GO desktop app
- [ ] Python based data app that shows scraped results in a dashboard
- [ ] Public Prometheus & Grafana
- [ ] Public health of hosted sites (....been working on this for a while...)
Branches Duties are:
- [ ] Terraform Projects: Build and destroy resources in my AWS account
- [ ] Container Builds: Building containers I have put together with dockerfiles, usually something like nginx. Packages stored in the repo
- [ ] Ansible playbooks: Books useful to me for configuration of EC2/VMs in AWS and Azure
