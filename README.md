## Features
Some of the big features I have to offer in this repository so far is:

### Built!:
- API gateway calls. Current app runs from 6am-8pm EST. You can grab the endpoint from the latest apply build. Working on having it static to an Route53 entry when I have time
- Working Terraform code to build and destroy. EKS cluster with apps deployed
- Successful container build pipelines, need to make my public ones...well...public

### To Be Built:
- [ ] route53 A record entry for the endpoint so we dont have to grab it everytime
- [ ] Branch based deployments for Github Actions. Each branch represents a targeted project deployment. 
- [ ] GO desktop app
- [ ] Python based data app that shows scraped results in a dashboard
- [ ] Public Prometheus & Grafana along with health of my endpoints/sites (....been working on this for a while...)t
- [ ] Ansible playbooks: Something begginer and useful for folks when doing STIGs, updates, anything

And more to come!
